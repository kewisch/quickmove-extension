          <h1>Quick Folder Move</h1>
          <p>
            Welcome to your updated version of Quick Folder Move. With this update comes a few
            adjustments that might reshape your workflow. To keep you in the loop, let's delve into
            these changes and keep any surprises at bay.
          </p>
          <p>
            This version adopts a newer extensions technology (MailExtensions), which promises
            greater stability. The flip side, though, is that this technology doesn't support
            every customization that you're used to. But don't worry, the following sections will
            guide you on adapting your workflow to this new version.
          </p>
          <p class="warning">
            This update contains some breaking changes. Please read through this page to the end to
            avoid the impression the add-on no longer works.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section image-right">
          <h2>All in one place</h2>
          <img src="images/toolbar.png" alt="Popup showing in the main toolbar" />
          <p>
            In the previous version, you had a variety of ways to launch the Quick Folder Move
            popup—from the message context menu to keyboard shortcuts. The location of the popup
            would vary, depending on what elements of the UI were active at the time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, your workflow is more streamlined. Use the button in the main toolbar no matter
            if you want to move, copy or go to a folder. This change makes your navigation more
            straightforward and less cluttered.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section image-left">
          <h2>Moving in context</h2>
          <img src="images/new-button.png" alt="New location for the button" />
          <p>
            In addition to the main toolbar button, you also have the option to move messages
            directly from the message header. This way you'll be able to take action right in
            context, and you'll be ready to tackle the next message without delay.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section image-right">
          <h2>Changing Muscle Memory</h2>
          <img src="images/shortcuts.png" alt="Managing shortcuts in the add-ons manager" />
          <p>
            The new technology restricts available keyboard shortcuts to prevent unexpected
            command changes. This means we'll bid farewell to Shift+M, welcoming
            <span class="platform-mac">Control+Shift+M</span>
            <span class="platform-default">Ctrl+Shift+N</span> for
            'move' instead <span class="platform-default">(N, not M)</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other actions such as 'copy' and 'goto' no longer have keyboard shortcuts defined by
            default. You can use the above mentioned keyboard shortcut and then use the left and
            right arrow keys to select a different action, or, assign your own.
          </p>
          <p>
            To assign or adjust keyboard shortcuts, use
            <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/manage-extension-shortcuts-firefox" target="_blank">the shortcut manager</a>
            in Thunderbird. This
            version also still allows forcing legacy shortcuts in
            <a id="openOptions" href="about:addons">this add-on's preferences</a>.
          </p>
          <form id="legacy-shortcuts-form">
            <label>
              <input type="radio" name="shortcuts" value="new" checked>
              Embracing change, I'm testing new shortcuts or tailoring them in the prefs.
            </label>
            <label>
              <input type="radio" name="shortcuts" value="legacy">
              Change is hard. I'll stick with the old shortcuts for now.
            </label>
          </form>
          <p>
            A future version of the add-on will remove the ability to use legacy shortcuts, so you
            may as well get used to the new ones now.
          </p>
