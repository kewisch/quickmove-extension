          <h1>Quick Folder Move</h1>
          <p>
            Welcome to Quick Folder Move! Getting to inbox zero can be difficult. There are many
            emails to triage, and it takes time to read and reply to each. Quick Folder Move is
            meant to reduce the time between emails. Those few extra clicks to move the message in a
            folder might not seem much, but with the amount of emails you receive every day it can
            add up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's see how to make best use of this add-on!
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section image-left">
          <h2>Moving in context</h2>
          <img src="images/new-button.png" alt="New location for the button" />
          <p>
            On each message, there is a button that will allow you to move or copy emails to a
            folder of your choice. Once you are in the popup, you can use the following to navigate:
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Left/Right Arrow</b>: Switch between 'move', 'copy' and other modes.</li>
              <li><b>Search box</b>: Use this to search for part of the folder name. You might only need 1-2 letters!</li>
              <li><b>Down/Up Arrow</b>: Move between the search box and the folder items.</li>
              <li><b>Enter</b>: When you've picked the folder you'd like, press enter to move the message. If it is the first folder, press enter right away.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section image-right">
          <h2>The keys to boost your speed</h2>
          <img src="images/shortcuts.png" alt="Managing shortcuts in the add-ons manager" />
          <p>
            Navigating with the keyboard is not confined to the popup. Ideally, you don't want to
            leave your keyboard when filing messages.
          </p>
          <p>
            As available keyboard shortcuts in Thunderbird are scarce, we'll start out with just one
            shortcut to take action on email:
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li class="platform-mac"><b>Control+Shift+M</b>: Open the popup to move the selected email message.</li>
              <li class="platform-default"><b>Ctrl+Shift+N</b>: Open the popup to move the selected email message.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p class="clear">
            In the add-ons manager, you can also
            <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/manage-extension-shortcuts-firefox" target="_blank">assign additional shortcuts</a>
            to open the popup directly with the copy, tag, or goto actions selected. Here, you can
            also customize the shortcut for moving messages. If you've used this add-on in the past
            please note Shift+M is no longer recommended due to restrictions in Thunderbird.
          </p>

            If you have any questions, please reach out via the add-on's <a href="https://github.com/kewisch/quickmove-extension" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>.
            This is also where you can help improve future versions of the add-on.

            If you enjoy Quick Folder Move, I'd appreciate your support for continued development of
            this add-on.
