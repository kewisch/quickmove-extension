          <h1>Quick Folder Move</h1>
          <p>
            Apologies for another message on upgrade, but this one is important especially if you've
            been having trouble with the keyboard shortcuts. Unfortunately shortcuts are scarce in
            Thunderbird, and some I had picked were already taken. In some cases this caused the
            wrong action to be executed.
          </p>
          <p>
            By default, I've now gone with just one shortcut assigned by default, allowing you to
            customize them to your needs instead. Note you can use the move shortcut and then
            the left/right arrow keys to adjust the action. Here are the currently assigned
            shortcuts, including any you have customized:
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul id="shortcut-list">
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            You can change these shortcuts or assign any that are unassigned in
            <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/manage-extension-shortcuts-firefox" target="_blank">the shortcut manager</a>,
            or temporarily go back to the legacy shortcuts in
            <a id="openOptions" href="about:addons">the add-on's preferences</a>.
