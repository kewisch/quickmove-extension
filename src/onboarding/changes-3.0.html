          <h1>Quick Folder Move‚ÄîSee what's new in 3.0</h1>
          <p>
            It all started with a simple idea‚ÄîI wanted to move my emails a bit faster to make my
            inbox more manageable. What began as a personal project has grown into a tool that many
            of you now use as a core part of your email workflow. Knowing that something I created
            is helping so many people is incredibly satisfying.

          <h2>Exclude Folders You Don't Need</h2>
          <img src="images/exclude-folders.png" alt="Folder picker with two excluded folders, one for important shared docs, one for secret files" />
          <p>
            You can now exclude specific folders from the search list, not just the archive folder.
            This gives you more control over your searches, letting you focus on the folders that
            matter most to you.
          </p>

          <h2>Direct Access to Tag and Unified Folders</h2>
          <img src="images/tags-unified.png" alt="Quick Folder Move popup showing the tags and unfied folders sections" />
          <p>
            Using the "goto" action, you can now jump straight to the Tag and Unified Folder views.
            This makes it easier to organize your emails by tags or to see all your messages in one
            place.
          </p>

          <h2>Choose How Recent Folders Work</h2>
          <img src="images/folder-strategy.png" alt="Add-on options showing folder strategy settings" />
          <p>
            Decide whether the recent folders view shows the folders you've recently viewed or those
            you've recently moved messages to. This helps you quickly access the folders that fit
            your workflow.

            I've also added a few more features and bugfixes, thanks to reports and requests from users like you. 
            <ul>
               <li>
                 Pressing <span class="platform-mac">Cmd</span><span class="platform-default">Ctrl</span>+Enter
                 when moving a message opens the folder immediately. This saves you a step if you
                 want to check the message you just moved.
               </li>
              <li>Folders with names including [brackets] are now fully supported, giving you more freedom in naming.</li>
              <li>The currently selected folder is excluded when moving messages to prevent accidental moves.</li>
              <li>Switching between actions now requires pressing <span class="platform-mac">Cmd</span><span class="platform-default">Ctrl</span> with the arrow keys, freeing up the arrows for navigation within the search bar.</li>
              <li>The folder picker in settings respects the "skip archive" option, showing only the folders you want.</li>
              <li>Lastly, the font size adapts to Thunderbird's settings for a more native feel; you can adjust it anytime in the Thunderbird menu if you prefer.</li>
            </ul>
